    <h3>Protection against erosion and storms:</h3>
    <p>
        The dense root systems of mangrove trees help stabilize coastal sediments, reducing erosion caused by waves and currents. Mangroves also act as natural buffers against storm surges and tsunamis, helping to protect coastal communities from the impacts of extreme weather events.
